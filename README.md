Discussion
==========

A way to get your audience to participate your presentation or event.
The admin can add questions or statements, and the users can reply on them. If the audience finds replies meaningful, or agree with them; they can upvote them.
This way, the most popular answers become apparent and the presenter
can use this as input.

In case you don't know what this is about: Happening is a group app for iOS and Android, that allows you to create your own plugins in minutes. To get started signup at: https://develop.happening.im

Don't worry: plugins are just Javascript (or CoffeeScript), both client-side and server-side. However, the powerful Happening environment provides you with user group details, a database that syncs to all clients, reactive user-interface widgets, and html/css for whatever else you may want to do. That social app you've wanted to build for ages, but didn't because it'd take you weeks? You'll finish it tonight.
